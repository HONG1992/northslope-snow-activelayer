This project will compare in situ measurements of active layer thickness depths
with remotely sensed estimates of snow seasonality. Snow seasoality is an 
important driver of active layer depths in permafrost regions. We expecte there 
to be a strong correlation between the duration of the snow free period and 
active layer depths over several years.
